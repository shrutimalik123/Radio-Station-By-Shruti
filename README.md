# Radio Station by Shruti Malik

A highly stylized, audio-only radio station web application featuring curated themes and a glassmorphism design.

## Features
- **Curated Themes**: 10 different vibes including Chill, 80s, Jazz, and Lofi.
- **Visualizer**: Dynamic CSS-based audio visualizer.
- **Premium Design**: Modern glassmorphism aesthetic with animated backgrounds.

## Current Status
**Work in Progress**: The application UI is fully functional with theme selection and visualizer. However, we are currently troubleshooting YouTube playback restrictions (Error 153/150) due to the hidden nature of the player. We will resume debugging in a future session.
